# Squishy-Bot
Hello all, welcome to Squishy Bot! This is a Discord bot written in Python using discord.py (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). At the time of writing this, I've just published Version 0.1b (b for beta) here on GitHub, because I feel that this version is solid enough to be worthy of being my first official "release" of this bot. Some features that are currently implimented include:
1) A profile system that displays a user's name, profile picture, and levels (at a later time)
2) Pat, hit, and hug commands that users can send to each other with GIFS
3) A "swear counter" that tracks how many times a user swears
4) Squishy's award winning (not really) "GayDar"
...and a few other hidden secrets :)

As far as features that I'm looking to implement in the future...
1) Improvements to the profile system, including changing your profile's color
2) A leveling system that will allow you to level up based on a variety of factors such as server interaction, scores in mini-games, etc.
3) Moderation functionality, such as kicking, banning, message tracking, role management, and more
4) ...a lot more stuff that I forgot about at the time of writing this lol

So yeah, this is Squishy Bot. If you happen to stumble across this, feel free to give me some feedback or use this as a base for creating your own bot. :)
